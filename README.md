# CapstoneProject - VITConnect

This project of ours is a social media app like Instagram, Facebook, etc. and we'll be using android studio in the course of this project. It will contain all the features of a typical social networking app like connections, sharing, commenting, etc. and as we will progress in the project we can add or eliminate features and functionalities in accordance with our needs.​
​
Social media now plays an important role in helping colleges stay connected with alumni and increasing the value of their education by expanding their institute's recognition. Institutions are now able to share alumni's life and career achievements on social media.​
The basic idea behind this project is to create a VIT-centric social media app that will provide for the engagement between the students, professors in VIT Bhopal.​
​
We can give a rudimentary start of the project; so the user will be able to login or sign up to create an account accordingly then we will have our newsfeed or the home page where the posts will be displayed.​
There will be tags and likes, comments the usual functionalities of social media apps.​
